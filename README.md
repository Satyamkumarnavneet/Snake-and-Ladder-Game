# Snake-and-Ladder-Game

This project is aimed at developing a Multiplayer Snakes and Ladders Game using Java & JavaFx.

Snakes and Ladders is an ancient Indian board game regarded today as a worldwide classic.  It is played between two or more players on a game board having numbered, gridded squares.

A number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares. The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to dice rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (Top Square), helped or hindered by ladders and snakes respectively.

-	Snakes and Ladders is a simple board game, for two to four players, in which the players race their token from start to finish according to dice rolls. 

-	The board is numbered grid squares, on certain squares of the grid are drawn a number of “ladders” and “snakes” connecting two squares together. 

-	The size of the grid (most commonly 8×8, 10×10 or 12×12) varies from board to board, as does the exact arrangement of the snakes and the ladders: both of these may affect the duration of game play.


Rules:
-	A minimum of two players and a maximum of four players can play this game. 

-	At the start of the game, the player's pieces are placed in the start area. 

-	Each of the active players shall have to wait for their turn one by one to roll the dice. 

-	The buttons should be moved according to the number appearing on the dice. 

-	Whenever the button of one player reaches the bottom of a ladder then the player can climb up the ladder to the respective position at the top of the ladder. 

-	If the button of one player reaches the square with a snake, the player has to retrace back to the square at the tail of the snake. 

-	The game is won when the button of a particular player reaches the finish point first.
